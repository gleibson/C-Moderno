# Modern C++

This project is a wiki explaining how to write Modern C++ code from the ground up.

I intend to cover the most used features of C++, in order to understand how and when use such features to craft a reliable, maintainable e efficient code. It means that I want to explore them to the bone, reading assembly if necessary but with no milestones (so far).

If you want to contribute, fixing English mistakes, wrong concepts or simply discuss a question don't think twice before mailing me here. You can open issues as well. :)
